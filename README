  Pixel Pong is a backend for the Pixel Ping stats collector.
  See Pixel Ping:
  
  http://github.com/documentcloud/pixel-ping
  
  == Getting Started
  
  First you should install the with-tracking-js branch of Pixel Ping via rake:
  
    rake pixel:install
  
  Pixel Ping's configuration files are stored in:
  
    pixel-ping.#{Rails.env}.json
  
  For example you can use this for development:
  
  {
    "port":     "9187",
    "host":     "127.0.0.1",
    "interval": 5,
    "endpoint": "http://127.0.0.1:3000/stats.json",
    "secret":   "one very good secret"
  }
  
  and save it in config/pixel-ping.development.json.
  
  Once you have filled out the details, boot this app, and run rake pixel:track to
  start an instance of Pixel Ping.
  
  After collecting a few stats you can go to the administration interface to view
  stats by day. (Screenshot: http://bit.ly/pixel-ping-admin)
